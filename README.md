## Description
This project is a full-stack application built with JavaScript, Handlebars.js, and MySQL that you can use in your daily life. Since almost everyone uses money daily and could probably be a little better at spending less/saving more, we decided an expenses tracker would be useful to most. We are targeting people that spend money and want more knowledge of what kind of things they buy the most, or how much they have leftover to spend/save. How we do this is by having the customer input there transactions and show a categorized pie chart custom to your spending.
